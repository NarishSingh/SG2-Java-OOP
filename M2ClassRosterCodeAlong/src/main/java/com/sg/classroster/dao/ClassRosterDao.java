/*
This interface defines the methods that must be implemented by any class that 
wants to play the role of DAO in the application. You could imagine, however, an 
implementation that only stored student data in memory or one that stored student
data in a database. Each class would be different but all would implement that 
same interface, ensuring that they are all well encapsulated. Note that the 
ClassRosterController only uses this interface to reference the DAO â€” it is 
completely unaware of the implementation details.

-for impl file
This is the text file-specific implementation of the ClassRosterDao interface.
