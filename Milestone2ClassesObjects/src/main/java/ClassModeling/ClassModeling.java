Define properties â€” determine which will be read/write and which will be read-only.
Implement setters and getters (as appropriate) for each property.
Implement a constructor to initialize some or all of the property values.
Determine what behaviors the class should have and then define (do not implement) the methods associated with each behavior.
Be prepared to explain the reasons behind all of your design decisions.
